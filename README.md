# Vinca colour theme

This is just a little earthy/dark theme that I designed with the intention of reducing the visual contrast between different highlighting styles so the flow of reading is still reasonable, as well as no blue or green tones (as these colours are very visually harsh)

There's more things I'd change if I knew how to select them in the JSON but this is nice enough for now.
